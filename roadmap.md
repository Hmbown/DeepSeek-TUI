# Roadmap

This roadmap captures planned work after the 0.3.8 line. Dates are intentionally omitted; versions are the delivery targets.

## 0.3.9 (Planned)
- Duo mode groundwork: refine prompts, validation flow, and UX surfacing for player/coach phases.
- Documentation: publish a concise Duo spec and user workflow guide.
- Tooling: tighten phase transitions and reporting in `duo_*` tools.

## 0.4.0 (Planned)
- RLM mode reintroduction: align design with the MIT RLM paper (REPL-style interaction + recursive sub-calls).
- External memory UX: improved loading/query ergonomics and clear persistence semantics.
- Documentation: RLM architecture and usage guide, with explicit parity notes.
